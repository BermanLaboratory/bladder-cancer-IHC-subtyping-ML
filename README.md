IHC based classifier to predict major subtype of bladder cancer:

Using available dataset on ~30 protein in ~300 samples from advanced bladder cancer tissue, a decision tree classifer model was made. The general steps that I followed to create this classifers are as:
### 1- data exploratory analysis (in R)
### 2- feature selection by ROC analysis (in R)
### 3- Creating a decision tree multiclass classifer (by sklearn library in Python) 

## data exploratory analysis
